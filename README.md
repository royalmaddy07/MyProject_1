# MyProject_1
This repositary contains the code for my project - PREDICTING STOCK PRICES USING KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST AND DISTRIBUTIONAL FITTING WITH WEIGHTED DISTRIBUTION AVERAGING.

NOTE 1 : After parsing/processing the raw_data.csv a historical_data.csv file will be generated. To this historical_data.csv file remove all the headers and write a single header line "Time,Closing price" for the main.cpp algorithm to process it and for result generation.

NOTE 2 : The main.cpp file uses an external c++ library called "boost" which has a "boost.math" sub-library which is very useful, as it contains helpful functions and classes for statistical computations. To download this library, you can use a package manager like MSYS2 or install it from the web.
